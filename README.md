Welcome to my Python automation project: Automating job application

This project is created to avoid the process of goind to job listings and apply them one by one. The projects include 4 py files:

	_ main.py : when the program starts
	
	_ setup.py : set up Browser and other several functions that can be used during the application process. When the program runs, it will ask for the user's credettials to log in the site. 
Then it will ask for the search keyword as well as the location users wish to perform
	
	_ indeed.py: contains all xpaths, variables and functions needed to auto-apply job on Indeed.com
	
	_ glassdoor.py: contains all functions neede to auto-apply job on glassdoor.com
The var_glassdoor.txt contains all variables and xpath needed to auto-apply job on glassdoor.com





How it works: 
	_ First, the program will ask for your git hub credentials. Rest assured that it won't display your passwords.
	_ Secondly, it will ask for the search keyword and the location. After you input the values, the automation starts.
